# Pytorch_UdacityScholarshipChallenge
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. It's possible to use something like this in a phone app that tells the name of the flower your camera is looking at. I'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content
