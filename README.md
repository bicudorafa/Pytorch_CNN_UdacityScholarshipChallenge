# Pytorch_UdacityScholarshipChallenge
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. It's possible to use something like this in a phone app that tells the name of the flower your camera is looking at. I'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

- Load and preprocess the image dataset
- Train the image classifier on your dataset
- Use the trained classifier to predict image content

# Instructions

The analysis was made using Python, trought the Colab plataform (powered by Google), using the Pytorch Deep Learning Framework. Also worth mentioning the data visualizations packages such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and others Ipython's built in.

# Guidelines

The work has 5 files:
- Environment: contain all the necessary settings/operations necessarys to enable the environment
- Image Classifier Project_rbr: The project itself
- cat_to_name: .json file with the flowes names mapping to labels
- Flowers: representation of the images with its names
